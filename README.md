# Ukraine Refugees
This repo relies on GitHub Actions to scrape [data](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) regularly from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The script runs twice each day, outputing CSVs files with details on refugees counts by [day](https://github.com/gridviz/ukraine-refugees/blob/main/data/processed/ukraine_refugees_totals_timeseries.csv) and [country](https://github.com/gridviz/ukraine-refugees/blob/main/data/processed/ukraine_refugees_totals_countries.csv).
